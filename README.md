# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days and log my progress.*

I plan to start this challenge in Jan 2019, until then I concentrate on theory about CS basics, Math and Advanced CSS Concepts.

### Day 01:  

**Today's Progress**:  I have completed the next lesson (Module 2 - Internet) of CS50's Understanding Technology course, and took notes of the Python course's latest lesson. I have learned about software testing methods.

**Thoughts**: I should refactor the monthly summary table in my LearningPath repo
