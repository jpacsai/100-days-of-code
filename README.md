### Day 01:  
#### ```October 01, Monday  ```

**Today's Progress**:  I have completed the next lesson (Module 2 - Internet) of CS50's Understanding Technology course, and took notes of the Python course's latest lesson. I have learned about software testing methods.

**Thoughts**: I should refactor the monthly summary table in my LearningPath repo

### Day 02:  
#### ```October 02, Tuesday  ```

**Today's Progress**:  Today I was tidying up my github repos and completed 1 kata on CodeWars

**Thoughts**: wrestling with markdown tables

***

### Day 03:  
#### ```October 03, Wednesday  ```

**Today's Progress**:  I'm doing the second module in Advanced CSS Concepts course, learning about CSS modules.

**Thoughts**: still wrestling with markdown tables!!! but I think I'm almost finished

***

### Day 04:  
#### ```October 04, Thursday  ```

**Today's Progress**:  Finished with the homework for the Advanced CSS Concepts course, made me seriously consider to have a look at my old projects' CSS. I have many-many courses lined up to take, will see where I can squeeze a little time for that. I have gone through a lot of Math practice today, feeling good about it, want to wrap this Algebra course up as fast as I can so I can procede with Precalculus.

**Thoughts**: markdown tables are ready in the LearningPath repo, much better :)
