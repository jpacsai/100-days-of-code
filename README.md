### Day 1: October 01, Monday
**Today's Progress**:  I have completed the next lesson (Module 2 - Internet) of CS50's Understanding Technology course, and took notes of the Python course's latest lesson. I have learned about software testing methods.

**Thoughts**: I should refactor the monthly summary table in my LearningPath repo
